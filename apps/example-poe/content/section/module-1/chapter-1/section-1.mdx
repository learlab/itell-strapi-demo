</Info>

**Economics** is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity. These can be individual decisions, family decisions, business decisions or societal decisions. If you look around carefully, you will see that scarcity is a fact of life. **Scarcity** means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is available. Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply. Of course, the ultimate scarce resource is time- everyone, rich or poor, has just 24 expendable hours in the day to earn income to acquire goods and services, for leisure time, or for sleep.

Think about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the United States contained over 158 million workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The total land area was 3,794,101 square miles. While these are certainly large numbers, they are not infinite. Because these resources are limited, so are the numbers of goods and services we produce with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem to be virtually infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a problem.

  If you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem, consider the following:

- Does everyone require food to eat?

- Does everyone need a decent place to live?

- Does everyone have access to healthcare?

In every country in the world, there are people who live without such critical goods and services at least partly because of scarcity. Let's delve into the concept of scarcity a little deeper, because it is crucial to understanding economics.

### Introduction to FRED

Data is very important in economics because it describes and measures the issues and problems that economics seek to understand. A variety of government agencies publish economic and social data. For this course, we will generally use data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's FRED database. FRED is very user friendly. It allows you to display data in tables or charts, and you can easily download it into spreadsheet form if you want to use the data for other purposes. The [FRED website](https://openstax.org/l/FRED/) includes data on nearly 400,000 domestic and international variables over time.

## The Problem of Scarcity

Think about all the things you consume: food, shelter, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. How do you acquire those items? You do not produce them yourself. You buy them. How do you afford the things you buy? You work for pay. If you do not, someone else does on your behalf. Yet most of us never have enough income to buy all the things we want. This is because of scarcity. So how do we solve it?

Every society, at every level, must make choices about how to use its resources. Families must decide whether to spend their money on a new car or a fancy vacation. Towns must choose whether to put more of the budget into police and fire protection or into the school system. Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to national defense or to protecting the environment. In most cases, there just isn't enough money in the budget to do everything. How do we use our limited resources the best way possible, that is, to obtain the most goods and services we can?

One option is that we could each produce everything we each consume. Think back to pioneer days, when individuals knew how to do so much more than we do today, from building their homes, to growing their crops, to hunting for food, to repairing their equipment. Alternatively, we could each produce some of what we want to consume, and “trade” for the rest of what we want. So why don't we do that?

Most of us do not know how to do all—or any—of those things, but it is not because we could not learn. Rather, we do not have to because of something called the **division and specialization of labor**, a production innovation first put forth by Adam Smith in his book, _The Wealth of Nations_.

## The Division and Specialization of Labor

<Columns>

<Column>
  The formal study of economics began when **Adam Smith** (1723-1790) published
  his famous book _The Wealth of Nations_ in 1776. Many authors had written on
  economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first to address the
  subject in a comprehensive way. In the first chapter, Smith introduces the
  concept of **division of labor**, which means that the way one produces a good
  or service is divided into a number of tasks that different workers perform,
  instead of all the tasks being done by the same person.

To illustrate division of labor, Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece of wire, cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a head on one end and a point on the other, and packaging pins for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18 distinct tasks that different people performed—all for a pin, believe it or not!

<Columns>
  <Column>
  Modern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides the task of serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the tables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills—not to mention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and the building where it is located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe factory ([Figure 1.4](1-1-what-is-economics-and-why-is-it-important#CNX_Econ_C01_009)), or a hospital can have hundreds of job classifications.

## Why the Division of Labor Increases Production

In Smith's observations of pin factories, Smith noticed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to complete two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a group of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves? He offered **three** reasons:

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem
    value="advantage"
    title="1. Workers specialize in particular tasks where they have an advantage."
  >
    **Specialization** in a particular task allows workers to focus on the parts
    of the production process where they have an advantage. People have
    different skills, talents, and interests which inform their educational
    choices, so they will be better at some jobs than at others. Only those with
    medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods,
    geography affects specialization. For example, it is easier to be a wheat
    farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier to run a tourist hotel in
    Florida than in North Dakota. Whatever the reason, if people specialize in
    the production of what they do best, they will be more effective than if
    they produce a combination of things, some of which they are good at and
    some of which they are not.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem
    value="faster"
    title="2. Workers who specialize work faster and produce higher quality."
  >
    Workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly
    and with higher quality. This pattern holds true for many workers, including
    assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and doctors
    who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often know their
    jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and
    better. A similar pattern often exists within businesses that focus on one
    or a few products -- sometimes called the “core competency”. Such businesses
    are often said to be more successful than firms that try to make a wide
    range of products.
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem
    value="scale"
    title='3. Businesses take advantage of "economies of scale".'
  >
    Specialization allows businesses to take advantage of **economies of
    scale**, which means that for many goods, as the level of production
    increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines. For
    example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be
    quite expensive to make on average. However, if a factory produces 50,000
    cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and
    workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per
    car will be lower.
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

The ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents, learn
to do their specialized jobs better, and work in larger organizations is that society
as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce
all of their own goods and services. The division and specialization of labor has
been a force against the problem of scarcity.

</div>

<div className="content-chunk" data-subsection-id = "trade-markets">

## Trade and Markets

Specialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they receive for doing their jobs to purchase the other goods and services that they need. In short, specialization requires trade.

You do not have to know anything about electronics or sound systems to play music—you just buy an iPod or MP3 player, download the music, and listen. You do not have to know anything about artificial fibers or the construction of sewing machines if you need a jacket—you just buy the jacket and wear it. You do not need to know anything about internal combustion engines to operate a car—you just get in and drive. Instead of trying to acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing all of the goods and services that you wish to consume, the market allows you to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy the goods and services you need or want. This is how our modern society has evolved into a strong economy.

## Why Study Economics?

<Callout>
  The study of economics does not dictate the answers, but it can illuminate how
  decisions are made in a variety of personal, business, and societal
  situations.
</Callout>

Now that you have an overview on what economics studies, let's quickly discuss why
you are right to study it. Economics is not primarily a collection of facts to memorize,
although there are plenty of important concepts to learn. Instead, think of economics
as a collection of questions to answer or puzzles to work. Most importantly, economics
provides the tools to solve those puzzles. If the economics “bug” has not bitten
you yet, there are other reasons why you should study economics.

- Virtually every major problem facing the world today, from global warming, to world poverty, to the conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia, has an economic dimension. If you are going to be part of solving those problems, you need to be able to understand them. Economics is crucial.

- It is hard to overstate the importance of economics to good citizenship. You need to be able to vote intelligently on budgets, regulations, and laws in general. When the U.S. government came close to a standstill at the end of 2012 due to the “fiscal cliff,” what were the issues? Did you know?

- A basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded thinker. When you read articles about economic issues, you will understand and be able to evaluate the writer's argument. When you hear classmates, co-workers, or political candidates talking about economics, you will be able to distinguish between common sense and nonsense. You will find new ways of thinking about current events and about personal and business decisions, as well as current events and politics.
